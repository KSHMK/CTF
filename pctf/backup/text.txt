What is e^(1.000000001)? 

Please enter in decimal with 7 places. 
(For example, if the answer was 2.71828183... the flag would be 2.7182818 )

Something doesn't seem quite right with this zip file. 

Can you fix it and get the flag?

Whatever happened to the good old days when we played on our Gameboys instead of doing this hacking stuff? ...I guess in retrospect not a whole lot has changed.

BB-8

Oh sorry, did I say BB-8? Like the Star Wars robot thing? 

Haha whoops… I meant BB-84… the Quantum Key Distribution protocol. 

That's my bad, I hope that wasn't misleading or anything.

If you hear enough, you may hear the whispers of a key...

You might need to turn your volume up really loud if you want to hear this. 

Yow, okay, maybe that was too loud.

We tried to make ChakraCore crazily secure. In doing so, we also removed some code that didn't seem too important.

Toaster Wars: Going Rogue, Episode 2.5 - 20000 Leagues Under the Sink 

I'd heard of the weird region-specific edition of TW:GR, but I didn't know they were planning on bringing it to the masses. And as a neat online game, no less! They just put out a public beta2 or public beta 3.

Download (NEW source -- bugfix) 

Part I: I found a locked box in Undersea Cavern once... and I think I saw a key in Calm Crystal Reef somewhere? Can you break the lock? 

Part II: Based on the site, there's a dungeon called Shallow Sand Bar that's only open to players from their closed alpha. Surely that won't stop you from getting the flag at the end of that dungeon. 

Part III: The boss at the end of Treacherous Trench, the Golden Spatula, is a jerk. Show him what you're made of and grab the flag!

I think I got rid of them all, but maybe there's still some left. 

Can you take a look?

If you didn’t get the memo, homomorphic encryption is the future. But we might have to work out a few bugs first.
